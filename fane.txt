This figure does not include sexual harassment",
                'q2': "45% to 55% of women have experienced sexual harassment since the age of 15 in the European Union confirmed by an EU-wide Survey done by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights in 2014.",
                'q3': "Human trafficking is the acquisition and exploitation of people, through means, such as force, fraud, coercion, or deception. This heinous crime ensnares millions of women and girls worldwide, many of whom are sexually exploited. 72% of all trafficking victims worldwide are women and girls. And 4 out of 5 trafficked women are trafficked for sexual exploitation.",
                'q4': "FGM includes procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. Beyond extreme physical and psychological pain, the practice carries many health risks, including death. At least 200 million women and girls aged 15-49 have undergone FGM in 30 countries where representative data is available. In most of these countries, the majority of girls were cut before age 5.",
                'q5': "Child marriage usually means an end to girl’s education, vocation and her right to make life choices. Research confirms that girls who marry in childhood are at greater risk for intimate partner violence than girls of the same age who marry later. 650 Million women and girls alive today were married before their 18th birthday. Almost 4 in 10 girls in sub-Saharan Africa were married before age 18."
